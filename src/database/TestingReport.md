# Testing Results:
#### By Simerus Mahesh
***

> The database system was thoroughly tested on January 27, 2023 by Simerus Mahesh using the white box testing method. The main objective of the testing was to evaluate the code structure of a Java class that was connected to an SQLite database and to ensure its proper functioning and error-free performance.
>
> The testing process covered a range of aspects, including verifying the correctness of code structure, checking the proper connection of the code to the SQLite database, and identifying and resolving any errors or bugs present in the code. The outcome of the testing was documented in a report that highlighted the results of the testing, including any errors or bugs that were identified and resolved.
>
> The project had a tight deadline of one day and no budget constraints were reported. The team had the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out the testing and was confident that the code and database provided were functional.
>
> The project schedule consisted of a single day of testing, with a budget of $100. The resources required for the project included a computer with Java and SQLite installed and access to the provided code and database.
>
> The project team followed industry best practices for code structure and database connections, and the quality standards were assessed by verifying that the code was structured properly and connected to the database, and by ensuring that any errors or bugs were resolved. The acceptance criteria for the testing included a detailed report that documented the results of the testing and any errors or bugs that were identified and resolved.
>
> Communication and reporting were managed by the project manager, Ali Rahbar, and involved the project team members. The project team provided regular updates and reported any issues to the project manager.
>
> Potential risks to the project included the possibility of not identifying all errors or bugs in the code or not being able to resolve them within the given time frame. The team managed these risks by performing thorough testing and reviewing the code and by regularly communicating with the project manager. In case errors or bugs were not resolved within the given time frame, the contingency plan was to extend the project deadline by one day.
>
> The scope of work document was reviewed and approved by Ali Rahbar, the Project Manager, and the stakeholders.
>
> In conclusion, the testing process was successful, and no errors or bugs were found in the code or database system. The team utilized the white box testing method and employed statement coverage, branch coverage, and path coverage techniques to thoroughly test the code and ensure its proper functioning.
