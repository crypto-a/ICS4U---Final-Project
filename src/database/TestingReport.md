# Testing Results:
#### By Simerus Mahesh
***

> The unit testing for the database system was completed on January 27, 2023 by Simerus Mahesh. The objective of the project was to test the code structure of a Java class that is connected to an SQLite database and ensure that it is functioning properly and is free of errors.
>
> The scope of the project included verifying the code structure was correct and followed best practices, verifying that the code was properly connected to the SQLite database, and identifying and resolving any errors or bugs in the code. The deliverable for the project was a report detailing the results of the testing and any errors or bugs that were identified and resolved.
>
> The project was constrained by a time frame of one day and no budget constraints were known. The assumption was that the code and database provided were functional and that the project team had the necessary knowledge and skills to complete the task.
>
> The project schedule included the following milestones:
> * Day 1: Test the code and check for errors.
>
> The task had a budget of $100. The resources required for the project included a computer with Java and SQLite installed, and access to the provided code and database.
>
> The project met industry best practices for code structure and database connections. The quality standards were measured by ensuring that the code was properly structured and connected to the database, and that any identified errors or bugs were resolved. The acceptance criteria for the deliverables included a report detailing the results of the testing and any errors or bugs that were identified and resolved.
>
> Communication and reporting were handled by the project manager, Ali Rahbar. The stakeholders that were involved in communication and reporting included the project team members. The project team reported progress and any issues to the project manager.
>
> Potential risks to the project included the possibility of not identifying all errors or bugs in the code, or not being able to resolve them in the given time frame. The risk management process included thorough testing and review of the code, as well as regular check-ins with the project manager. In the event that errors or bugs were not resolved within the given time frame, the contingency plan was to extend the project deadline by one day.
>
> The scope of work document was approved by Ali Rahbar, Project Manager, and the stakeholders who have reviewed and approved the scope of work document.
>
> Overall, the testing was completed successfully and no errors were found in the code or database system.
