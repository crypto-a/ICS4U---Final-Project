## Assigned to: Simerus Mahesh 
## Due Date: January 27, 2023
***

### Project Background and Objectives:

> The project's idea is to test the code structure of a Java class that is connected to an SQLite database. The objective of the project is to ensure that the code is functioning properly and is free of errors. The code will be provided for testing and error checking. The project manager is Ali Rahbar.

### Project Scope and Deliverables:

> The project's scope includes testing the code structure of the Java class and ensuring that it is properly connected to the SQLite database. Specific tasks that need to be accomplished include:
> * Verifying that the code structure is correct and follows best practices
> * Verifying that the code is properly connected to the SQLite database
> * Identifying and resolving any errors or bugs in the code 
> * The deliverables that will be produced include a report detailing the results of the testing and any errors or bugs that were identified and resolved.


### Project Constraints and Assumptions:

> The project is constrained by a time frame of one Day. No budget constraints are known. The assumption is that the code and database provided are functional and that the project team has the necessary knowledge and skills to complete the task.


### Project Schedule and Milestones:

> The project schedule includes the following milestones:
>
> * Day 1: Test the code and check for errors.


### Project Budget and Resources:

> The Task has a budget of $100. The resources required for the project include a computer with Java and SQLite installed, and access to the provided code and database.


### Quality Standards and Acceptance Criteria:

> The project must meet industry best practices for code structure and database connections. The quality standards will be measured by ensuring that the code is properly structured and connected to the database, and that any identified errors or bugs are resolved. The acceptance criteria for the deliverables include a report detailing the results of the testing and any errors or bugs that were identified and resolved.


### Communication and Reporting Requirements:

> Communication and reporting will be handled by the project manager, Ali Rahbar. The stakeholders that will be involved in communication and reporting include the project team members. The project team will report progress and any issues to the project manager.


### Risk Management and Contingency Plans:

> Potential risks to the project include the possibility of not identifying all errors or bugs in the code, or not being able to resolve them in the given time frame. The risk management process includes thorough testing and review of the code, as well as regular check-ins with the project manager. In the event that errors or bugs are not resolved within the given time frame, the contingency plan is to extend the project deadline by one day.


### Approval:

> Approved by _Ali Rahbar_, Project Manager, and the stakeholders who have reviewed and approved the scope of work document.
