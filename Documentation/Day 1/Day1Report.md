## Researching different database options:
> In this report, we will analyze and compare three different database options for a Java software. The options we will be discussing are SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. These databases are all widely used in the Java ecosystem and are known for their reliability and performance.

### SQLite

> SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database that is widely used in embedded systems and mobile devices. It is known for its small footprint and easy deployment, making it a popular choice for Java developers. SQLite is also open-source and has a large community of developers constantly working to improve it. One of the main advantages of SQLite is its simplicity. It is easy to set up and use, and it does not require a separate server to run. This makes it a great option for small-scale projects or for developers who are new to databases. Another advantage of SQLite is its performance. It is known for its fast read and write speeds, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, SQLite is highly portable and can run on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. One potential drawback of SQLite is its scalability. While it is suitable for small-scale projects, it may not be the best option for larger projects that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, SQLite does not support advanced features such as stored procedures and triggers, which may limit its functionality in some cases.

### MySQL

> MySQL is a widely used, open-source relational database management system. It is known for its reliability and performance, making it a popular choice for Java developers. MySQL is also highly customizable, and it supports a wide range of features, including stored procedures, triggers, and views. One of the main advantages of MySQL is its scalability. It is suitable for small-scale projects, as well as large-scale projects that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, MySQL is highly customizable, which allows developers to tailor it to their specific needs. Another advantage of MySQL is its robustness. It is known for its reliability and performance, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, MySQL is widely supported, and it has a large community of developers constantly working to improve it. One potential drawback of MySQL is its complexity. It is more complex to set up and use than SQLite, and it requires a separate server to run. Additionally, MySQL is less portable than SQLite, and it may not run on some platforms.

### PostgreSQL

> PostgreSQL is a widely used, open-source relational database management system. It is known for its robustness and performance, making it a popular choice for Java developers. PostgreSQL is also highly customizable and it supports a wide range of features, including stored procedures, triggers, and views. One of the main advantages of PostgreSQL is its scalability. It is suitable for small-scale projects, as well as large-scale projects that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, PostgreSQL is highly customizable, which allows developers to tailor it to their specific needs. Another advantage of PostgreSQL is its robustness. It is known for its reliability and performance, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, PostgreSQL is widely supported and it has a large community of developers constantly working to improve it. One potential drawback of PostgreSQL is its complexity. It is more complex to set up and use than SQLite, and it requires a separate server to run. Additionally, PostgreSQL is less portable than SQLite, and it may not

## Chosen database system:
> Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that SQLite is a great option for a Java software. Its small footprint and easy deployment make it perfect for small-scale projects or for developers who are new to databases. Its simplicity and portability are also noteworthy. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database that is known for its fast read and write speeds, making it ideal for applications that need to handle a lot of data. Additionally, SQLite is open-source and has a large community of developers constantly working to improve it. Overall, SQLite's ease of use, performance, and portability make it a suitable choice for a Java software.

## Database features:
* 3 Tables (one for each animal)
* Basic CRUD operations
* Will save all the properties of the animal objects

# Day 1 Report (written by Project manager):
> The project had a great start and everything is going as planed. Today different databases where researched and SQLite was chosen as the best for the project. The features of the database where also Listed for tomorrows work.
