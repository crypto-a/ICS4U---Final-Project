## Executive Summary
> The GUI Assessment Data Base Implementation project aims to create a database system to store objects in the animal arraylists in order to prevent loss of user data. The project includes researching and selecting a DBMS, designing and implementing the database, integrating it with existing software, testing, documenting and debugging. It will be completed in 6 days by one person with a budget of $1400 for equipment and labor. Risks include difficulties in choosing the right DBMS, compatibility issues, complexity in design and integration, delays, budget overruns, changes in regulations and natural disasters. There are also risks related to communication with stakeholders and among team members.


## Project Description:
> The project aims to create a database system for a GUI Assessment project to ensure that user data is not lost when the code execution stops. The database will be designed to be scalable, flexible, and easy to use, and will support various types of data, including Strings and integers. The project will involve designing and implementing the database and integrating it with the existing GUI assessment software. The project will be divided into several phases, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment and will be completed in 6 days with a team of one person.

> ### Equipment and material:
>   - Database management system (DBMS) software: The project will require a DBMS software to design, implement, and manage the database. This can be an open-source or proprietary software, depending on the project requirements and constraints. Examples of popular DBMS software are MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
>   - Development tools: The project will require a range of development tools such as Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor to write and test the code, version control software (e.g. Git) to manage the codebase and collaborate with the team, and debugging tools to identify and fix issues in the code.
>   - Hardware: The project will require a computer or server to host the DBMS software and the database, and storage devices to store the data.
> ***
>
> ### External Resources:
>   - ChatGPT: ChatGPT can provide answers to technical questions and provide guidance on various aspects of the project, such as project management, database design, and software development. It can assist in writing documentation, creating project schedule, and identifying risks.
>   - Technical forums and communities: There are various online forums and communities, such as Stack Overflow, that provide answers to technical questions and solutions to common problems related to database design, software development, and project management.
>   - Tutorials and documentation: There are many tutorials and documentation available online, such as the official documentation of the chosen DBMS, that can provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for various aspects of the project.

## Communication Plan:
>  ### Key Stockholders:

> ### Stakeholder communication needs:
>   - Project sponsor: The project sponsor will need regular updates on the project progress, issues, and risks to ensure the project aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the organization.
>   - End-users: The end-users will need to be informed about the project, its progress and its timeline, in order to have clear expectations about when the new GUI assessment software will be available for use.
> ***
>
> ### Communication channels:
>   - Project Managment Plan: A PMP will be created at the beginning of the project to define the scope, objectives, and stakeholders of the project.
>   - Gantt Chart: A Gantt Chart will be created at the beginning of the project to define the timeline, and milestones of the project.
>   - Project status report emails: A project status report will be created and emailed at the end of each Day to summarize the project progress, issues, and risks.
>   - Technical documentation: Technical documentation will be created and distributed at the end of the project to provide information on the design and implementation of the database and the integration with the GUI assessment software.

## Quality Management Plan:
> When testing the software the functionality is key and is prioritized. After the functionality, the tester will focus on the optimization of the code.
> Furthermore, All codes must have proper documentation including comments, pseudocode and IPO charts.

## Procurement Plan:
> ### Requirements:
>   - One person with knowledge of database design and implementation.
>   - Access to a database management system (DBMS) software.
>   - Access to the current GUI Assessment project source code.
> ***
>
> ### Procedure and timelines:
>   - Research and evaluation of DBMS options: This process will involve researching and evaluating different DBMS options to determine which one is the best fit for the project. It will take approximately 1 Day to complete.
>   - Programming: This process will involve coding in java, commenting and documenting files using pseudocode and IPO charts. This process will take around 2-3 days to complete.
>   - Testing: This process will require the programmer to develop some basic codes for testing as well as fake data (ChatGPT will be used to generate the fake data). This process wil take around a day.
>   - Deploying: This process will require the programmer to change the following sections of the code to implement the database:
      >     1. File: ObjectManager
               >        1. constructor method
>        2. Add a method to load data
>        3. Add a method to save data
>     2. File: GUI
         >        1. Call the save file before ending the code

## Change Management Plan
> As the Project is only 6 Days long, management change is rare. However, the procedure is the as follows:
> ***
>
> 1. **Identify the change:** The first step in the change request process is to identify the change that needs to be made. This can be done by reviewing project documentation, conducting project status meetings, or receiving input from stakeholders.
> ***
>
> 2. **Evaluate the change:** Once the change has been identified, it will be evaluated to determine its impact on the project. This includes assessing the impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources, as well as the impact on project stakeholders.
> ***
>
> 3. **Approve or reject the change:** Based on the evaluation, the change will be approved or rejected. If the change is approved, it will be implemented according to the change management plan. If the change is rejected, the reasons for the rejection will be communicated to the stakeholders.
> ***
>
> 4. **Implement the change:** Once the change has been approved, it will be implemented according to the change management plan. This includes communicating the change to stakeholders, updating project documentation, and training project team members as necessary.
> ***
>
> 5. **Monitor and evaluate the change:** After the change has been implemented, it will be monitored and evaluated to determine its impact on the project. Any issues or problems that arise as a result of the change will be addressed and resolved.
